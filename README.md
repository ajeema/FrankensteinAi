Heimdall
Welcome to Heimdall, a versatile, agent-based orchestration platform inspired by the Norse god Heimdall, the watchman of the gods. This platform is designed to empower teams by automating and coordinating a variety of tasks across software development, including code generation, project planning, and testing.

Features
Heimdall leverages multiple specialized agents, each designed to handle specific aspects of the software development lifecycle:

Code Generation Agent: Automates the creation of boilerplate code and supports multiple programming languages.
Planning Agent: Uses AI to assist in project management, task allocation, and timeline predictions.
Testing Agent: Implements automated testing strategies to ensure code quality and reliability.
Each agent in Heimdall operates both independently and collaboratively, ensuring that all aspects of your software project are synchronized and efficiently managed.
